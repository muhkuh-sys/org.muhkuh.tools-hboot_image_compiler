v0.0.11

netX 90 APP image compiler:

  * Add command line argument to specify the chip type.
  
  * Rename argument --sdsize to --sdram_split_offset. 
    New default value is 0 (i.e. SDRAM exclusive to APP CPU). 
  
  * Allow building an empty dummy image by passing a "," as the segment list. 
    When there is no data for an image, the header will be written anyway.
  
  * Do not build a boot image if its output file name has been omitted from 
    the command line or an empty string is passed.
  
  * Keep track of segments in the ELF file containing data and which ones have
    been output to a boot image.
  
  * Set the destination address in the boot header if the address is in the SDRAM. 
    Otherwise, set it to 0.
  
netX 4000 HBoot image compiler:

  * Allow building execute CA9 chunks with both target addresses set to 0 to enable 
    JTAG debugging.

v0.0.10

  * Add support for the chip type netx 90 Rev.1 (NETX90B)
  
  * Add netx90_app_image.py, allowing to build multi-part boot images for the netx 90 APP CPU.
  
  * Add data type String to Concat node.
  

v0.0.9

  * Add flash device and offset information to boot header (optional).

  * Improved error message when call to objdump/objcopy/readelf fails.

  * Support Firewall settings for netx 90 Full.
  

v0.0.8

  * Support REGI chunk for netx 90 Full.

  * Fix "Exec" chunk for netX90 MPW.
    The netX90 introduced an additional DWORD in the "Exec" chunk which was erroneously added for the MPW.


v0.0.7

  * Support file aliases in "skip" chunks.

  * Add all chunks for the netX90 FULL.

  * Separate data items with comma.

  * Remove the obsolete netx90 MPW APP support.

  * Add an image type for alternative images on netX90, netX4000 and netX4100.

  * Add the address of the netX4000 "portcontrol_init" as "apply_port_control".

  * Read contents for a "Skip" chunk from an ELF file.


v0.0.6

  * Add "SkipIncomplete" tag.

  * Search the start symbol in the symbol table first and use the file header as a fallback.

  * Ignore structure declarations from the ELF debug information.


v0.0.5

  * Support option chunks for the netX90 MPW.

  * Add the possibility to read the keys for the trust paths, license, CR7
    software and CA9 software chunks from a file.

  * Pass the keyrom location from the command line to the generator.

  * Use a public key for the trust paths.

  * Add support for netX4000 and netX4100.

  * Add UInt32, UInt16, UInt8 and Concat nodes to specify data blocks.


v0.0.4

  * Add a new option "-S" / "--sniplib" to specify a sniplib location.
    The option can be used multiple times to specify more than one sniplib.

  * Accept hexadecimal values for the "offset" attribute.

  * Fix the "Skip" and "XIP" chunks for non zero offsets.

  * Read the RootCert, LicenseCert, CA9Software and CR7Software chunks from a
    file, if a "File" child node is present.


v0.0.3

  * Support the SQIROM0 and SQIROM1 areas on the netX4000.

  * Add "fill" and "file" attributes to the "Skip" tag.

  * Create "Text" chunks.

  * Add the attributes "has_header" and "has_end" to control the output of the header and end marker.


v0.0.2

  * Add a "overwrite_address" attribute for data chunks from ELF sections.
    It allows to overwrite the load address of the data.

  * Add a "segments" attribute to use only the selected segments from an ELF
    file.

  * Fix the command line interpreter to accept the "NETX90_MPW_APP" for
    "--netx-type".

  * Change the extraction method of the start address from an ELF file.
    The old way extracted all symbols with the "readelf" tool and searched for
    a global symbol with the name "start".
    The new way reads the file header - again with the "readelf" tool - and
    extracts the line with the "Entry point address".


v0.0.1 (15.12.2016)
