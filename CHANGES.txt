  * Add the chip type NETX90C/netx90_rev2 and its patch table.
  
  * Add the attributes 'min_size' and 'min_size_fill_value' to the HBootImage 
    tag, which allow specifying a minimum size for the generated boot image. 
    If the size of the image is smaller, it is padded to the minimum size. 
    If 'min_size_fill_value' is specified with a 32-bit value, this value is 
    used for padding, otherwise 0xffffffff is used.

  * Add the attribute 'max_size' to the HBootImage tag, which allows 
    specifying a maximum size for the generated boot image. 
    If the size of the image exceeds the maximum size, an error is raised.

  * Support creating signed APP images for netX 90 rev. 1 and 2
    (using the attribute "signed_binding" in the ASIG chunk).

  * Add the secure copy/SCPY chunk for netx 90 Rev. 0 and Rev. 1 (and later)

  * netx90_app_iflash_image.py is deprecated, use netx90_app_image.py instead.

  * Allow SkipIncomplete into hash table

  * Allow RAW option data to be larger than 255 bytes.

  * Allow reading the contents of an option chunk from a binary file.
    (Only tested with RAW options)

  * Issue a warning if the key index in a HTBL chunk is not 17, or if the key index in an USIP chunk is greater than 17 (and not 0xff).

  * Add command --version.

  * Add license text (GPL v2).
  
Features supported only by the netx90 Rev. 2:

  * Correct next header address in APP images located in Intflash2. (allows multi-part images in Intflash2)

  * Support HTBL chunks with filler data 

  * Exclude the filler data in a HTBL chunk from the signature.

  * Add attribute 'apply_firewall_settings_full' to execute chunk.

  * Add bxlr feature to exec chunk
 

v0.0.12

  * add support for secure boot and license handling for netX 4000

  * add support for secure boot for netX 90

  * add new public netX names for all tools

  * remove temporary file .sniplib.dblite

  * include license information

v0.0.11

netX 90 APP image compiler:

  * Add command line argument to specify the chip type.
  
  * Rename argument --sdsize to --sdram_split_offset. 
    New default value is 0 (i.e. SDRAM exclusive to APP CPU). 
  
  * Allow building an empty dummy image by passing a "," as the segment list. 
    When there is no data for an image, the header will be written anyway.
  
  * Do not build a boot image if its output file name has been omitted from 
    the command line or an empty string is passed.
  
  * Keep track of segments in the ELF file containing data and which ones have
    been output to a boot image.
  
  * Set the destination address in the boot header if the address is in the SDRAM. 
    Otherwise, set it to 0.
  
netX 4000 HBoot image compiler:

  * Allow building execute CA9 chunks with both target addresses set to 0 to enable 
    JTAG debugging.

v0.0.10

  * Add support for the chip type netx 90 Rev.1 (NETX90B)
  
  * Add netx90_app_image.py, allowing to build multi-part boot images for the netx 90 APP CPU.
  
  * Add data type String to Concat node.
  

v0.0.9

  * Add flash device and offset information to boot header (optional).

  * Improved error message when call to objdump/objcopy/readelf fails.

  * Support Firewall settings for netx 90 Full.
  

v0.0.8

  * Support REGI chunk for netx 90 Full.

  * Fix "Exec" chunk for netX90 MPW.
    The netX90 introduced an additional DWORD in the "Exec" chunk which was erroneously added for the MPW.


v0.0.7

  * Support file aliases in "skip" chunks.

  * Add all chunks for the netX90 FULL.

  * Separate data items with comma.

  * Remove the obsolete netx90 MPW APP support.

  * Add an image type for alternative images on netX90, netX4000 and netX4100.

  * Add the address of the netX4000 "portcontrol_init" as "apply_port_control".

  * Read contents for a "Skip" chunk from an ELF file.


v0.0.6

  * Add "SkipIncomplete" tag.

  * Search the start symbol in the symbol table first and use the file header as a fallback.

  * Ignore structure declarations from the ELF debug information.


v0.0.5

  * Support option chunks for the netX90 MPW.

  * Add the possibility to read the keys for the trust paths, license, CR7
    software and CA9 software chunks from a file.

  * Pass the keyrom location from the command line to the generator.

  * Use a public key for the trust paths.

  * Add support for netX4000 and netX4100.

  * Add UInt32, UInt16, UInt8 and Concat nodes to specify data blocks.


v0.0.4

  * Add a new option "-S" / "--sniplib" to specify a sniplib location.
    The option can be used multiple times to specify more than one sniplib.

  * Accept hexadecimal values for the "offset" attribute.

  * Fix the "Skip" and "XIP" chunks for non zero offsets.

  * Read the RootCert, LicenseCert, CA9Software and CR7Software chunks from a
    file, if a "File" child node is present.


v0.0.3

  * Support the SQIROM0 and SQIROM1 areas on the netX4000.

  * Add "fill" and "file" attributes to the "Skip" tag.

  * Create "Text" chunks.

  * Add the attributes "has_header" and "has_end" to control the output of the header and end marker.


v0.0.2

  * Add a "overwrite_address" attribute for data chunks from ELF sections.
    It allows to overwrite the load address of the data.

  * Add a "segments" attribute to use only the selected segments from an ELF
    file.

  * Fix the command line interpreter to accept the "NETX90_MPW_APP" for
    "--netx-type".

  * Change the extraction method of the start address from an ELF file.
    The old way extracted all symbols with the "readelf" tool and searched for
    a global symbol with the name "start".
    The new way reads the file header - again with the "readelf" tool - and
    extracts the line with the "Entry point address".


v0.0.1 (15.12.2016)

  Initial release.
